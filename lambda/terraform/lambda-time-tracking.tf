# Time Tracking Lambda Functions
# NOTE: These functions are disabled until zip files are built

# All time tracking Lambda functions are commented out until the build process
# creates the necessary zip files. Run `npm run build` and the packaging
# script to generate these files.

# Placeholder for future time tracking Lambda functions:
# - manage_time_sessions
# - get_active_session
# - get_sessions
# - get_session_entries
# - get_time_tracking_statistics
# - export_time_tracking_data
# - manage_time_tracking_templates
