# Location Tracking Lambda Functions
# NOTE: These functions are disabled until zip files are built

# All location tracking Lambda functions are commented out until the build process
# creates the necessary zip files. Run `npm run build` and the packaging
# script to generate these files.

# Placeholder for future location tracking Lambda functions:
# - real_time_location
# - get_active_sessions
# - get_tracking_events
# - get_tracking_statistics
# - share_tracking_link
# - get_shared_tracking
