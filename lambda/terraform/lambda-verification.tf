# Verification Lambda Functions
# NOTE: These functions are disabled until zip files are built

# All verification Lambda functions are commented out until the build process
# creates the necessary zip files. Run `npm run build` and the packaging
# script to generate these files.

# Placeholder for future verification Lambda functions:
# - get_verification_requirements
# - get_verification_status
# - upload_verification_documents
# - submit_verification_review
